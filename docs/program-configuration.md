# Program Configuration

Queued uses external YAML files to define the programs and their process behaviors. These files are referenced via the `include` directive in your main configuration, typically using a glob path like:

```yaml
include: "programs/*.yml"
```

Each program configuration defines how a specific command should run, how many instances to spawn, startup behavior, environment variables, logging, and more.

## Example Configuration


```arduino
arduino:
  group: "web"
  command: "/usr/bin/my-server --port=8080"
  autoStart: true
  autoRestart: true
  startSecs: 5
  slowStart: 2
  numProcs: 3
  user: "appuser"
  stdout: "/var/log/my-server/stdout.log"
  stderr: "/var/log/my-server/stderr.log"
  env:
    - "ENV=production"
    - "DEBUG=false"
```

## Program Fields

|Field|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`group`|string|Group label for this program|
|`command`|string|The full command to run|
|`autoStart`|boolean|Start the program automatically on server start|
|`autoRestart`|boolean|Restart the process automatically if it stops|
|`startSecs`|int|Seconds to wait before considering the process successfully started|
|`slowStart`|int|Delay (in seconds) between starting multiple processes|
|`numProcs`|int|Number of process instances to spawn|
|`user`|string|Run the process as this user|
|`stdout`|string|File path to write standard output logs|
|`stderr`|string|File path to write error output logs|
|`env`|[]string|List of environment variables (`KEY=value`)|

## Process Metadata (Read-Only)

Queued manages runtime information per process, available via the API or CLI. These fields are not meant to be configured manually:

|Field|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`lastStart`|timestamp|Last time the process was started|
|`processName`|string|Full process name (`<group>:<index>`)|
|`programName`|string|Parent program name|
|`processIndex`|int|Index of the process in the group|
|`pid`|int?|Current PID of the running process|
|`status`|string|Current status: `stopped`, `running`, etc.|

> üìù These fields are managed internally and typically returned by the API or CLI when querying process status.

You can create multiple YAML files for different program groups (e.g., workers, jobs, services) and organize them inside the directory you specify in `include`.

Example structure:

```
config.yml
programs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ web-server.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ worker.yml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scheduler.yml
```
